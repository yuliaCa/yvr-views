# yvr-views

The application is about best viewpoints in and around Vancouver. Users can see the existing list of the viewpoints added by the author and add their own viewpoints.
You can add favorite viewpoints to the Favorites section.

## Features

- Using the React Router to navigate among the components.
- All Viewpoints - this page renders the existing information from MongoDB through axios request. While the data is being fetched, the browser indicates Loading state.
- Add New - has the form with basic mongoose validation. Upon submitting the form the array of viewpoints updates and user gets redirected to the All Viewpoints page to see the full list of viewpoints, including the newly added viewpoint.
- Favourites - has a label with the number of items in the Favourites list. Implemented with React Context.

* As you click on the button Add to Favourites, the item gets pushed into favorites collection.
